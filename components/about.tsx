        Iâ€™m currently studying Mechanical Engineering in Marmara University.
        After I realized my affection in programming, I decided to pursue my
        passion. I enrolled in a coding bootcamp and learned
        <span className="font-medium"> full-stack development</span>. My
        favorite part of programming is the problem-solving aspect. I love the
        feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack
        is React, Next Js, Flutter and Firebase . I am also familiar with Sql,
        C++ and Typescript. I am always looking to learn new technologies. I am
        currently looking for a full-time position as a software developer.
        <p>
          When I am not coding, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and
          doing sports as rowing. I also enjoy learning new things. I am
          currently learning about history and archeology.
